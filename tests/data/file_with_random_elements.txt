This is a simple document that contains a few pieces of random data. Because of
this, it is not possible to test with exact string matching.

The transform will be used to take the randomness out of both the original and
expected document.

This line won't clash: id=12345
This line won't either: class="23456"
This one will, but not on the id: id=34567, CHANGE_ME
This one will, but not on the class: class="45678", CHANGE_ME

Voil√† !
